        <p> Hello! I am Jadon Brutcher, a current student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, studying software
            engineering and data science. I am realy interested
            in data and the potential it has to change the world. I have done several projects on Machine Learning and
            Artificial Inteligence, and I hope that in my future career I can use data to help make decisions that will
            impact many people in a positive way. Besides my interest in data science, I also have experience developing
            software, with projects such as simulations, games, and graph-search algorithms. After Rose-Hulman, I hope
            to attend a graduate program for Data Science and Information Technology, as well as pursue degrees in
            Economics, Psychology, and Statistics. </p>

        <p> Some more personal facts about me include: I own a cat named B, I like to play video games, listen to music,
            trade on the stock market, watch movies, and I'm really interested in blockchain and cryptocurrency
            technology. I was born and raised in Indiana, and right behind my house is a cornfield. My favorite color
            is orange, and some of my favorite foods include spaghetti, popcorn, and eggs benedict. My favorite TV show
            is Peaky Blinders, and my favorite movie(s) are The Lord of the Rings trilogy. On the portfolio page are some
            projects I've done, and the resume page has my current resume.</p>
