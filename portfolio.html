                <img src="images/GApic.png" />
                <p>For my CSSE220 class, my teammate and I created a basic genetic algorithm that simulated the
                    evolution process. This process involved a population of 2D arrays of 1's and 0's, that would evolve
                    towards a solution over many generations. This involved fitness scores, selection, mutation, and
                    crossover. This was my first large project in Java, and it challenged me and helped me gain
                    experience.</p>

                <h2><a href="#">Graph Project</a></h2>
                <img src="images/GPpic.png" />
                <p>For my CSSE230 class, my teammates and I created a GUI designed to take a starting and ending
                    location and try to find the optimal route between them to either minimize time or distance. We used
                    A* search with trigonometric equations that mapped longitude and latitude to cartesian coordiantes
                    to make sure we were accurate. This gave us great experience with complicated datastructures,
                    because the Graph itself was fully implemented by my team and me.</p>
