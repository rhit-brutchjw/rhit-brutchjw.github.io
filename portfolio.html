                <p>For my CSSE220 class, My teammate and I created a basic genetic algorithm that simulated the
                    evolution process. This process involved a population of 2D arrays of 1's and 0's, that would evolve
                    towards a solution over many generations. This involved fitness scores, selection, mutation, and
                    crossover.</p>
